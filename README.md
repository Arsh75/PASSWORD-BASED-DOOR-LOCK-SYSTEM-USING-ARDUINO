# PASSWORD-BASED-DOOR-LOCK-SYSTEM-USING-ARDUINO
This project is to develop a smart door lock using Arduino Uno that provides excellent security and quick access
To Build this system we will be requiring the Hardware
components Arduino Uno,16×2 LCD display, 4×4 Matrix Keypad, Servo
Motor.

First we will simulate the design in Tinkler card online software

This is how looks like when we design the circuit 
After Checking the software know we will take hardware components to make the circiut
